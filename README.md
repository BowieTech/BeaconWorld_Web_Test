# Cin7 to Extensiv Sales Order Integration

## ðŸ“‹ Overview
This project demonstrates a one-way integration from **Cin7 Omni** (the client's inventory/order system) to **Extensiv** (3PL warehouse system), designed as a .NET Console Application. The integration extracts sales orders from Cin7 and transforms them into a format compatible with Extensiv's order creation API.
### Technical Stack & Framework

- **Framework**: .NET 9.0 Console Application
- **Architecture**: Layered architecture with Dependency Injection
- **Design Patterns**: Adapter Pattern, Repository Pattern, Service Layer Pattern
- **HTTP Client**: Built-in HttpClient with custom API services
- **Authentication**:
  - Cin7: Basic Authentication (username:apikey)
  - Extensiv: OAuth 2.0 Token-based authentication with auto-refresh
- **Configuration**: Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration with JSON-based configuration and first-time setup wizard
- **Data Serialization**: Newtonsoft.Json 13.0.3 for API request/response handling
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive exception handling with detailed logging
- **Testing**: Integration tests and individual API endpoint testing
---
# Interpretation of Client Requirements

The client expects a lightweight, one-way integration that:

### Core Requirements
- **Automated Order Transfer**: Seamlessly move order data from Cin7 to Extensiv without manual intervention
- **Previous Day Order Processing**: Process orders modified on the previous day to ensure timely fulfillment
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Ensure orders are not processed multiple times through intelligent duplicate detection
- **Flexible Business Models**: Support various commercial models (one-time, subscription, pay-per-use)
- **Minimal Configuration**: Simple setup process with sensible defaults and configuration wizard
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling with detailed logging for troubleshooting
- **Security**: Secure API communications with proper authentication mechanisms
- **Manual Execution**: Triggered manually via console application rather than continuous operation

### Business Value
- **Operational Efficiency**: Eliminate manual order entry and reduce processing time
- **Accuracy**: Reduce human errors in order transcription and field mapping
- **Scalability**: Handle varying order volumes without manual scaling
- **Cost Effectiveness**: Minimize operational overhead while maintaining reliability

### Based on these expectations, I designed the solution to:

- **Query orders modified on the previous day**, assuming that newly created or recently updated orders are ready for 3PL sync
- Use the `GET /SalesOrders?where=...` Cin7 API endpoint to retrieve multiple orders in a paginated fashion
- Map the order data into the required Extensiv format via an adapter class
- Include **line items, shipping address, billing info, and carrier routing instructions** in the transformation
- Log errors clearly and continue processing other records if individual orders fail validation or API submission
- Implement **duplicate detection** using Extensiv's RQL query functionality to prevent reprocessing
- Provide **comprehensive error handling** with detailed console output for troubleshooting
- Support **multiple business models** through configurable delivery model settings

#  Overall Approach and Design Decisions

### 1. Modular Architecture & Adapter Pattern

The solution applies the **Adapter Pattern** to isolate transformation logic between systems with different data contracts. This improves maintainability and testability, especially as API schemas evolve or additional systems are introduced.

- The `IOrderAdapter` interface defines a consistent transformation contract.
- `OrderAdapter` implements the mapping from `Cin7Order` to `ExtensivOrder`.

```csharp
public interface IOrderAdapter
{
    ExtensivOrder Convert(Cin7Order source);
}
```

---

### 2. Project Structure (Layered Design)
```
Cin7ToExtensiv/
â”œâ”€â”€ Models/              # Data models for Cin7, Extensiv, and configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ Services/            # API services and business logic
â”œâ”€â”€ Interfaces/          # Service contracts and abstractions
â”œâ”€â”€ Adapters/            # Order transformation and mapping logic
â””â”€â”€ Configuration/       # Settings and credential management
```
---

### 3. Secure Authentication & HTTPS Communication

Both Cin7 and 3PL Central APIs **require encrypted communication over HTTPS**. Plain HTTP is strictly prohibited by both platforms to ensure secure data exchange.

####  3.1 Cin7 Authentication

- Uses **Basic Authentication**.
- Each request includes a base64-encoded `username:apiKey` in the header.
- No token caching required (credentials are sent per request).

```http
Authorization: Basic <base64-encoded-credentials>
```

#### 3.2 3PL Central Authentication

- Uses **Token-based authentication** (OAuth-like).
- An access token is retrieved via `POST /AuthServer/api/Token`.
- The token **expires every hour** and is **auto-refreshed every 50â€“55 minutes**.

```http
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
```

#### 3.3 Token Management & Storage:
- **Token Storage**: Extensiv OAuth tokens are stored in-memory during application execution (not persisted to disk)
- **Token Lifecycle**: Tokens expire every 60 minutes and are automatically refreshed before expiration
- **Token Reuse**: Active tokens are reused for multiple API calls within the same execution session
- **Refresh Strategy**: Proactive token refresh occurs at 50-55 minute intervals to prevent expiration during operations

#### 3.4 Retry Mechanisms:
- **Authentication Failures**: Automatic retry with fresh token acquisition on 401 Unauthorized responses
- **Network Failures**: Built-in HttpClient retry for transient network issues
- **Rate Limiting**: Respects API rate limits with appropriate delays between requests
- **Token Refresh Failures**: Fallback to complete re-authentication if token refresh fails

#### 3.5 Security Features:
- **HTTPS Only**: All API communications encrypted via TLS/SSL
- **Credential Protection**: API keys and secrets stored in local configuration files (not in source code)
- **No Token Persistence**: OAuth tokens are never written to disk or logs for security
- **Secure Headers**: Proper HTTP headers including User-Agent, Accept, and Content-Type

---
### 4. Main Logic Flow

1. **Authentication Phase**: Validate Cin7 credentials and obtain Extensiv OAuth token
2. **Order Retrieval**: Query Cin7 API for orders modified in the previous day using date filters
3. **Data Validation**: Validate each order for required fields (customer, items, shipping address)
4. **Duplicate Detection**: Check Extensiv using RQL queries to prevent reprocessing existing orders
5. **Order Transformation**: Apply field mapping via OrderAdapter to convert Cin7 format to Extensiv format
6. **Order Submission**: Create orders in Extensiv via POST /orders API with proper error handling
7. **Result Tracking**: Log success/failure status for each order with detailed error messages
8. **Final Reporting**: Generate execution summary with statistics and recommendations
---

### 6. Configuration & Flexibility

 **First-time Setup Wizard**: Interactive configuration for easy deployment
- **Environment Support**: Configuration via appsettings.json with environment variable overrides
- **Business Model Support**: Four delivery models (One-Time, Pay-As-You-Go, Subscription, Just-in-Time)
- **Flexible Mappings**: Configurable customer IDs, facility IDs, and billing codes

#### Configuration Components:
- **Cin7 Credentials**: Username (email) and API Key configured in `appsettings.json` under `Cin7` section
- **3PL Auth Client Info**: Extensiv Client ID, Client Secret, and User Login ID configured under `Extensiv` section
- **Facility/Customer Codes**: Default Facility ID and Customer ID mappings configured under `Extensiv` section
- **Billing and Carrier Fallbacks**: Default billing codes and carrier mapping rules configured under `Extensiv` section

## Assumptions Made During the Integration

### 1. Business Assumptions

| Area | Assumption |
|------|------------|
| **Order Scope** | The integration is assumed to fetch **all orders modified on the previous UTC day** at the time of execution (e.g., 2025-07-14 from 00:00 to 23:59 UTC). |
| **Dispatched Status** | It is assumed that **orders modified the previous day have not yet been dispatched**, and **all earlier orders have already been dispatched**. |
| **Time Zone** | All timestamps returned by the Cin7 API are assumed to be in **UTC**, and **no timezone adjustments** are required during filtering or processing. |
| **Execution Model** | The integration is assumed to be **manually triggered** by the operator and not automated or real-time. |
| **Order Eligibility** | Only orders with status `Approved` and `Dispatched` are eligible for syncing. Draft or Voided orders are ignored. |
| **Volume Expectations** | The daily number of eligible orders is assumed to be **within 250 per day** (the default Cin7 pagination limit), unless clarified otherwise. |

---

### 2.Field Mapping Assumptions

| 3PL Field | Cin7 Field | Assumption |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| `billingCode` | `freightDescription`, `freightTotal`, `paymentTerms` | Cin7 does not have a dedicated billing type field. I infer the billing method (e.g., Prepaid, Collect) from payment or freight context. |
| `routingInfo.mode` | `freightDescription`, `deliveryInstructions` | No service level indicator exists. I assume shipping urgency or service (e.g., Ground, Overnight) can be inferred from text content. |
| `routingInfo.account` | `customFields['carrierAccount']` (if exists) | Cin7 does not expose shipping account numbers. I assume this must be stored in a custom field or mapped via config. |
| `routingInfo.scacCode` | Not provided | Cin7 lacks SCAC codes. I assume these must be resolved via config mapping from carrier name (e.g., FedEx â†’ FXFE). |
| `customerIdentifier` / `facilityIdentifier` | `memberId`, `distributionCenter`, `branchId` | These identifiers are assumed to be known values mapped from Cin7 to 3PL via config (e.g., mapping `branchId:3 â†’ LAX-WH`). |
| `orderItems.itemIdentifier.sku` | `LineItems[].Code`, fallback to `Barcode` | 3PL requires exact SKU. I assume Cin7â€™s `Code` is the primary SKU; use `Barcode` if `Code` is missing. |
| `orderItems.qty` | `LineItems[].uomQtyOrdered` or `qty` | If `uomQtyOrdered` exists, use it as the primary quantity; otherwise, use standard `qty`. |

---

### 3. Implementation / Technical Assumptions

| Area                    |   Assumption                                                                                                                                                  |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **API Reliability**          | Both the Cin7 and Extensiv APIs are assumed to be stable and reliable, with low failure rates and minimal downtime.                                             |
| **Time Zone Consistency**    | Cin7 and Extensiv operate in the same time zone or use a normalized standard (e.g., UTC), so no timezone offset handling is needed.                             |
| **Authentication**           | Cin7 Basic Auth credentials remain valid throughout execution. Extensiv OAuth tokens are assumed refreshable when expired (every hour).                         |
| **Token Refresh**            | 3PL tokens are reused within their 1-hour TTL, refreshed every ~55 minutes to avoid expiry errors.                                                  |
| **Pagination**               | A single dayâ€™s orders can be fetched using 250-record pagination. Further batching is handled as needed.    |
| **Configuration**            | The `appsettings.json` file is accessible and writable during first-time setup, and all required configuration sections are serializable/deserializable.        |
| **Flexible Delivery Models** | This integration supports various fulfillment models via the same API/config structure:<br>- One-Time (manual)<br>- Subscription (scheduled)<br>- Pay-as-you-go |



# ðŸ“Œ What to Clarify with the Client Before Deployment

Before going live with the Cin7 â†’ Extensiv integration, the following business and technical items should be confirmed with the client to ensure the solution fits their real-world operation and avoids unexpected behaviors.

---

## 1. Business Logic Clarifications

### Order Timeframe & Time Zone

* Are **Cin7 timestamps in UTC**, or should we apply a specific time zone (e.g., PST, AEST)?
* Should we pull **orders modified yesterday**, or **orders created yesterday**?

### Order Status Eligibility

* Should the integration only process `Approved` and `Dispatched` orders?
* What should happen if an order was previously sent and then **updated** in Cin7 â€” should it be re-sent?

### Duplicate Detection

* We use the Extensiv `referenceNum` to detect duplicates. Is that sufficient?
* If a duplicate is found, should we **skip**, **overwrite**, or **raise an alert**?

### Business Models & Fulfillment Flow

* Which business model(s) does the client use: **One-Time**, **Subscription**, **Just-in-Time**, or **Pay-As-You-Go**?
* Do they operate with **multiple facilities or warehouse customers**, and if so, should those be dynamically mapped?

### Error Handling Expectations

* Should failed orders be **reprocessed automatically** later, or handled manually?
* Would the client prefer **email reports**, **error logs**, or some dashboard for reviewing failed submissions?

---

## 2. Field Mapping Clarifications

### Customer & Facility Identifiers

* Can the client provide a mapping table between **Cin7 MemberId / BranchId** and **Extensiv customerIdentifier / facilityIdentifier**?

### SKU Format

* Does every product in Cin7 have a valid `Code`? Can we fall back to `Barcode`?
* Are **SKUs case-sensitive** in the Extensiv system?

### Billing Code Inference

* We infer the `billingCode` from `freightDescription`, `paymentTerms`, or `freightTotal`. Is this accurate for their billing setup?
* Do they have specific billing codes per **carrier or customer type**?

### SCAC and Carrier Accounts

* Can the client provide a **carrier-to-SCAC code mapping** (e.g., FedEx â†’ FXFE)?
* Do they use multiple **carrier account numbers**, and if so, are they stored in **custom fields** in Cin7?

### Custom Fields

* Are any critical values (e.g., `carrierAccount`, `deliveryInstructions`) stored in **custom fields** in Cin7?
* Can the client provide sample data for reference?

---

## 3. Operational Setup & Deployment Support

### Local Environment Requirements

* Will the integration run on a **local server**, **cloud VM**, or **dedicated machine**?
* Is **.NET 9.0 runtime** already installed? Do they need help setting it up?

### Trigger Mechanism

* The solution is designed to be **manually run via console**. Does the client need support for:

  * **Windows Task Scheduler**
  * **cron job (Linux)**
  * or **a RESTful trigger wrapper**?

### Configuration & Secrets Management

* Will the `appsettings.json` file be updated directly?
* Do they prefer using **environment variables** or a **key vault** for sensitive data (e.g., API keys)?

### First-Time Testing & Support

* Does the client need **technical assistance during first deployment**?
* Should the first run be performed in a **staging / sandbox** environment?

---

# How I Would Enhance the Solution for Production Use

## 1. From the Client / Business Perspective

### Service Model Design per Fulfillment Type

* Clearly define how each business model is handled during integration:

  * **One-Time Purchase**: Orders are processed immediately with no recurring logic.
  * **Subscription (Monthly)**: Orders are generated based on a scheduled cadence (e.g., every 30 days).
  * **Pay-As-You-Go**: Orders are triggered dynamically when usage thresholds or triggers are met (requires usage tracking input).
  * **Event-Driven Fulfillment**: Orders are generated in response to specific events such as webhook triggers, external actions, or marketplace events.
* Add flags or configuration mappings to classify order type and define sync strategy accordingly.
* Ensure that future extensibility allows multiple models per customer or SKU as needed.

### Scheduled Automation

* Set up automatic execution using Windows Task Scheduler, cron job, or a cloud function (e.g., Azure Function).
* Ensures consistent daily syncs without manual intervention.

### Email Alerts & Reporting

* Add daily email reports for:

  * Successful order sync summaries
  * Failed orders with reasons
* Include CSV or log file attachments.

### Staging & Production Environment Separation

* Support separate config profiles for dev/staging/production.
* Use environment variables for safer deployment and CI/CD.

### Dashboard / Admin Interface

* Optional admin interface to:

  * View recent logs
  * Reprocess failed orders
  * Update mappings without editing JSON manually

### Audit Logging

* Add structured logs for:

  * API calls and results (redact sensitive data)
  * Duplicate detection reasons
  * Token lifecycle events

---

## 2. From the Code / Architecture Perspective

### Unit Test Coverage

* Expand test coverage with xUnit/NUnit.
* Test adapters, validators, and edge cases with mocked services.

### Logging Infrastructure

* Use Serilog or Microsoft.Extensions.Logging for structured logs.
* Enable writing to file, console, or external systems (e.g., Seq).

### Retry & Resilience Framework

* Add retry logic using Polly (for transient errors, rate limits).
* Implement exponential backoff and circuit-breaker patterns.

### Configuration Validation

* Validate appsettings.json schema at startup.
* Prevent runtime failures due to missing or invalid configs.

### Plug-in Architecture

* Decouple adapters to support multiple platforms in the future (e.g., Shopify â†’ Extensiv).
* Register converters via DI or reflection.

### CLI Parameter Support

* Allow runtime options like:

  * \--from / --to date filters
  * \--dry-run for safe testing
  * \--verbose for debugging

### Containerization Support

* Package as Docker image for portability.
* Suitable for deploying in Kubernetes, ECS, or CI/CD pipelines.
